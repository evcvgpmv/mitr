We often deal with complex issues in Third Line Support, where users encounter problems such as position upload failures, and need book-level details to resolve their issues. Currently, these requests require manual 
intervention, requiring support agents to retrieve specific data, like book balances, journal entries, or position details.

Imagine a scenario where an AI assistant is built to handle these types of requests autonomously. Users could simply ask for book details, journal entries, or information related to their position upload issues, 
and the system would retrieve the necessary data from the database and respond in natural language—just like a human support agent.

This AI assistant would dramatically streamline our workflow, reduce manual effort, and improve the overall user experience.

Key Use Cases:
Here are a few examples of how users could interact with this AI-powered support system:

User Query:
"Provide the top 10 books and their balances."
AI Response: "Here are the top 10 books and their current balances:

Book_01: $1,500,000
Book_02: $1,200,000

User Query:
"I am a Vals user, my position upload is not working. Can you provide book details for book Book_26?"
AI Response: "The details for Book_26 are as follows:

Book Type: Credit

How It Works:
Natural Language Understanding: Users will type queries in simple natural language (e.g., “Provide me journal entries for book Book_26”). The AI agent, powered by GPT-4 or a similar model,
 will parse and understand the intent behind the query. It doesn’t require the user to know any SQL or complex syntax.


Benefits:
Increased Efficiency:
Users get immediate access to the data they need, without having to wait for a support agent to manually query the system. This will speed up issue resolution, 
particularly for recurring queries like book details and position uploads.

Reduced Support Load:
By automating frequent queries, this system will allow third-line support agents to focus on more complex or escalated issues, rather than spending time fetching routine data.

Improved User Experience:
Users will appreciate the ability to get real-time, accurate responses to their queries in a conversational manner. 
The system makes technical information more accessible, empowering users to resolve issues without the need for technical expertise.

Accessibility:
With no need for SQL knowledge or technical training, the system makes database interactions accessible to non-technical users. Whether they’re asking for a balance, journal entries, or position upload details, the AI assistant makes querying intuitive.

Support Integration:
Implement the system as a part of the third-line support workflow, allowing agents to escalate to the system when appropriate.

Conclusion:
The proposed AI Support Assistant would revolutionize the way we handle Third Line Support tasks. By enabling users to interact with the system in natural language, we can automate frequent queries and reduce the burden on support agents, while improving response times and user satisfaction.

With this AI assistant, users can easily retrieve book details, journal entries, and other essential information, making it a valuable tool for both support teams and end-users.
